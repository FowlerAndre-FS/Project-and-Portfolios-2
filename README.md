### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control. This work will help me begin to build a portfolio of skills and accomplishment that can be shared in the future. 

Here's what I worked on this past week..

**Week 1**: This week i learned about .gitignore and what files are able to be used with such sensitive information. The next topic i learned has been the three types of version control.  

**Week 2**: From the beginning of the week i was having trouble learning about Unified Modeling Language. The resources in class helped me understand that a 'fork' could send nodes to different nodes. Many more aspects about UML i've learned, but cant wait for what next week has in store.   

**Week 3**: During these week the focus was on development of the app in the dev folder. I learned more about streamwriter and the way the implement a streamwriter with 'new'. The next thing i learned this week was about static and non-static methods which are similar in ways but has a key difference.  

**Week 4**: This is the final week, felt like i learned so much in so little time. On the last week i learned how to add a list of users to the code in the dev folder. This became useful to understand the history of user within the menu itself.
