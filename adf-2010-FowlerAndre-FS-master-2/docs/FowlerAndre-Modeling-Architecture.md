This paper addresses some of the topic matter covered in research and activity this week. Be sure to include reference links below to the research and information you used to complete this assignment.

## Topic: Activity Diagrams
Professional developers have the ability to understand simple UML sketch diagrams. It's essential to understand some of the fundamental symbols to communicate well with others. 

Update the information below to demonstrate your knowledge on this topic.   

**1. Common Symbols.**

Describe what each UML symbol outlined below is used for in an Activity Diagram. 

**The last bullet provides an example**.

* Diamond: [ A Diamond indicates a decison ] 
* Solid Circle: [ Indicates that the flow continues where a matching symbol has been placed. Connector. ] 
* Solid Line and Arrow: [ Means association or extend to interface ]
* Dotted Line and Text connecting to a Diamond: [ Realization / Implementation ]
* Rectangle: [ A rectangle or box represent a single step and/or an entire sub process. Action or Process ]
* Solid Circle surrounded by another Circle: [ Database ]
* A symbol called "Fork": [ A Fork an control node that splits a flow into multiple concurrent flows.  ]
* **A symbol called "Join"**: A join is a solid line that denotes where two possible steps in a program flow resolve to the same next step. 


**2. Linear vs Non-Linear**

What is the difference between a linear and non-linear process? 

[ Linear- Straight line and always in a line, one direction. ]
[ Non-Linear- mostly are feature curves, not one directional. The output not directly proportional to it input. ]

## Topic: Class Diagrams
UML can also be used to create class diagrams. Respond below to show your understanding of this topic.   

**1. List at least three symbols that denote Accessibility (aka Visibility) in a Class Diagram.**

[ Features ]
[ Constraints ]
[ Semantics (Meaning) ]

**2. What does the term "Attributes" mean in a Class Diagram? Provide one or more examples.**

[ The Attributes notation describes a property as a line of text within the class box itself. ]
[ - name: String [1] = "Untitled" {readOnly} ]   

**3. What does the term "Operations" mean in a Class Diagram? Provide one or more examples.**

[ Operations are the actions that a class knows to carry out, most obviously correspond to the methods on a class. ]
[ - name: String [1] = "Untitled" {readOnly} ]


**4. What is the benefit of defining a minimum set of requirements at the beginning of a project? Also explain the what the term "minimum viable product" means in development.**  

[ To have a clear understanding of the problem  ]
[ Minimum Viable product- A new product that allow a team to collect the maximum amount of valided learning about customers with the least effort. ]
